# gpgpu-comparison

Program to analyze the dependence of execution time on different CPU/GPU/Memory clock frequencies by solving a mathematical equation with 5 variables using parallelization techniques with WinAPI (CPU), OpenCL (CPU/GPU), and CUDA (GPU).

## Getting Started

1. Install required software:  
    You will need the `CUDA Toolkit` (used V12.6.85) and `Visual Studio` (used V17.6.4)

2. Clone the Repository:  

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/slymachenko/gpgpu-comparison.git
    cd gpgpu-comparison
    ```

3. Set up PATH variables:  
    Ensure that the PATH variables for the `CUDA Toolkit` are correctly set.

4. Open project in `Visual Studio`
5. Compile and run
